# Memory Bank - dir-kill Project

## Purpose
This memory bank serves as the comprehensive knowledge repository for the dir-kill project. It contains all the essential information needed to understand, maintain, and extend the project, ensuring continuity across development sessions.

## Structure

### Core Files (Required)
1. **`projectbrief.md`** - Foundation document defining core requirements and goals
2. **`productContext.md`** - Why this project exists and how it should work
3. **`systemPatterns.md`** - System architecture and technical decisions
4. **`techContext.md`** - Technologies used and development setup
5. **`activeContext.md`** - Current work focus and recent changes
6. **`progress.md`** - What works, what's left to build, and current status

### Additional Files
- **`.cursorrules`** - Project intelligence and development patterns (in project root)

## Usage

### For New Developers
1. Start with `projectbrief.md` to understand the project scope
2. Read `productContext.md` to understand user needs and workflows
3. Review `systemPatterns.md` for technical architecture
4. Check `techContext.md` for development setup
5. Read `activeContext.md` for current status
6. Review `progress.md` for what's implemented and what's next

### For Ongoing Development
- **Before starting work**: Read `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`
- **After making changes**: Update relevant memory bank files
- **When adding features**: Update `progress.md` and `activeContext.md`
- **For architectural decisions**: Document in `systemPatterns.md`

### For Project Maintenance
- **Regular reviews**: Update all files monthly or after major changes
- **Knowledge transfer**: Use memory bank for onboarding new team members
- **Decision tracking**: Document important decisions in relevant files
- **Progress tracking**: Keep `progress.md` updated with current status

## File Relationships
```
projectbrief.md → Defines scope and requirements
       ↓
productContext.md → User needs and workflows
       ↓
systemPatterns.md → Technical architecture
       ↓
techContext.md → Development setup
       ↓
activeContext.md → Current work focus
       ↓
progress.md → Implementation status
```

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When to Update
- **After major feature completion**: Update `progress.md` and `activeContext.md`
- **After architectural changes**: Update `systemPatterns.md`
- **After technology changes**: Update `techContext.md`
- **After user feedback**: Update `productContext.md`
- **After scope changes**: Update `projectbrief.md`

### Update Process
1. **Review**: Read all memory bank files to understand current state
2. **Identify**: Determine which files need updates
3. **Update**: Make necessary changes with clear explanations
4. **Verify**: Ensure consistency across all files
5. **Commit**: Include memory bank updates in version control

### Quality Standards
- **Accuracy**: All information must be current and correct
- **Completeness**: Cover all important aspects of the project
- **Clarity**: Write in clear, understandable language
- **Consistency**: Ensure information is consistent across files
- **Relevance**: Focus on information that helps with development

## Success Metrics
- **Knowledge Retention**: New developers can understand the project quickly
- **Decision Quality**: Better decisions based on documented context
- **Development Speed**: Faster development with clear guidance
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Easier maintenance with documented patterns
- **Team Onboarding**: Reduced time to productivity for new team members

## Future Enhancements
- **Automated Updates**: Scripts to keep memory bank current
