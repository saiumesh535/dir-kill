# Active Context: dir-kill

## Current Work Focus

### ðŸŽ¯ New Direction: btop-style UI Enhancement Project
The project is adding **visual enhancements and UI improvements** inspired by btop's sophisticated approach to data visualization, search, filtering, and sorting.

**Critical Constraint**: Core search and delete functionality remains **completely unchanged** - this is purely a UI enhancement project.

### Recent Major Achievement: Production-Ready Directory Management Tool
The project has achieved production-ready status with all core features implemented and thoroughly tested:
- **87 Tests Passing**: Comprehensive test coverage with 100% success rate
- **Complete Feature Set**: CLI, TUI, selection, size calculation, progressive visual deletion
- **Performance Optimized**: Real-time scanning, lazy loading, efficient UI with 60fps target
- **User Experience Excellence**: Beautiful animations, responsive design, comprehensive error handling

## Current State

### âœ… What's Working (Unchanged)
- **Core Search Logic**: `fs::find_directories` with pattern matching
- **Core Delete Logic**: `fs::delete_directory` with safety checks
- **Core Size Calculation**: Background thread scanning with channels
- **Core Selection System**: Multi-select with keyboard shortcuts
- **Core TUI Framework**: ratatui-based interface with crossterm
- **Core Error Handling**: anyhow-based error propagation
- **Core Testing**: 87 comprehensive tests with tempfile isolation

### ðŸŽ¨ What We're Adding (UI Only)
- **Visual Search Bar**: Real-time filtering interface
- **Enhanced Sorting UI**: Visual controls for existing data
- **Advanced Filtering UI**: Size/date range visual controls
- **Improved Data Visualization**: Better charts, graphs, progress bars
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Better keyboard shortcuts and visual feedback
- **Status Information**: More detailed real-time statistics
- **Theme Improvements**: Better color schemes and visual hierarchy

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: UI Layer Enhancements (Weeks 1-2)
- Add search input field to existing TUI
- Implement real-time filtering of existing DirectoryInfo data
- Add visual sorting controls
- Enhance existing status display

### Phase 2: Advanced Visualization (Weeks 3-4)
- Add size distribution charts
- Implement progress bars for operations
- Enhance directory tree visualization
- Add real-time statistics panels

### Phase 3: Advanced Filtering UI (Weeks 5-6)
- Add size range filter controls
- Implement date range filter interface
- Add pattern-based filter UI
- Enhance search history display

### Phase 4: Performance & Polish (Weeks 7-8)
- Optimize UI rendering performance
- Add keyboard shortcut improvements
- Implement theme customization
- Add configuration options

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Weeks 9-10)
- Add export functionality UI
- Implement batch operations interface
- Add help system and documentation
- Final polish and testing

## Technical Approach

### UI-Only Changes
- **No Core Logic Changes**: All fs/ module functions remain unchanged
- **No CLI Changes**: Command-line interface remains the same
- **No Data Structure Changes**: DirectoryInfo and other structs unchanged
- **UI Layer Only**: All changes in ui/ module and visual presentation

### Risk Mitigation
- **Preserve Core Functionality**: 87 tests continue to pass unchanged
- **Incremental UI Updates**: Add features one at a time
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Visual Enhancement Focus**: Only improving presentation layer

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Review Current UI Structure**: Understand existing ui/ module layout
2. **Plan Search Bar Integration**: Design how to add search input to existing TUI
3. **Identify UI Enhancement Points**: Map where visual improvements can be added
4. **Create UI Enhancement Tasks**: Break down visual improvements into specific tasks

### Success Criteria
- **Zero Core Functionality Changes**: All existing features work identically
- **Enhanced Visual Experience**: UI feels more like btop's sophisticated interface
- **Improved User Workflow**: Better search, filtering, and navigation experience
- **Maintained Performance**: UI remains responsive and efficient

## Key Decisions

### UI Enhancement Philosophy
- **Additive Only**: Never modify existing core functionality
- **Visual Focus**: Improve presentation without changing behavior
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Add features incrementally
- **User Experience First**: Prioritize visual improvements that enhance workflow

### Technical Constraints
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing APIs and behaviors preserved
- **UI Layer Isolation**: Changes contained to presentation layer
- **Performance Preservation**: Maintain current performance characteristics
- **Test Compatibility**: All existing tests continue to pass

This approach ensures we can enhance the user experience significantly while maintaining the rock-solid foundation of the existing codebase.
