## Recent Changes

### Latest Enhancements (Most Recent)
1. **Test Coverage Expansion** (Latest)
   - **Increased Test Count**: From 82 to 87 tests with 100% pass rate
   - **Comprehensive Coverage**: All modules thoroughly tested
   - **Edge Case Testing**: Robust testing for various scenarios and error conditions
   - **Performance Testing**: Critical path benchmarking and optimization

2. **Progressive Visual Deletion** (`src/ui/app.rs`, `src/ui/mod.rs`, `src/fs/mod.rs`)
   - **Visual Progressive Feedback**: Shows "[deleting...]" next to paths being deleted
   - **Real-time Status Updates**: Items show deletion status without refreshing the entire list
   - **Multiple Key Combinations**: `[F]`, `[x]` or `[Ctrl+D]` for current directory, `[X]` or `[Ctrl+Shift+D]` for selected directories
   - **Enhanced Safety**: Multiple key combinations to prevent accidental deletions
   - **Status Indicators**: Normal, Deleting, Deleted, and Error states with color coding
   - **Icon-based Status Display**: Deletion status shown with intuitive icons inline with directory paths
   - **Real-time Status Updates**: Immediate status changes without blocking UI thread

3. **Animated Directory Icons** (`src/ui/mod.rs`)
   - Replaced static `[x]`/`[ ]` indicators with animated `üìÇ`/`üìÅ` icons
   - Different animation speeds for selected vs highlighted items
   - Added subtle selection checkmark alongside animated icons
   - Enhanced color scheme with glow effects

4. **Selection System Improvements**
   - Multi-select capabilities with keyboard shortcuts
   - Visual selection indicators with animated feedback
   - Selection summary with count and total size
   - Toggle selection mode functionality

5. **UI Polish and Refinements**
   - Gruvbox dark theme implementation
   - Real-time scanning with loading animations
   - Pagination with dynamic sizing
   - Multi-panel layout (directory list + details)

### Previous Major Milestones
1. **CLI Implementation** - clap-based command parsing
2. **TUI Foundation** - ratatui integration with crossterm
3. **File System Module** - Directory scanning and size calculation
4. **Real-time Scanning** - Background threads with channel communication
5. **Lazy Size Calculation** - Non-blocking size computation
6. **Selection System** - Multi-select with visual feedback
7. **Testing Infrastructure** - Comprehensive TDD approach

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Current Technical Decisions
1. **Animation Timing**: 
   - Selected items: 120ms animation cycle (faster, more attention-grabbing)
   - Highlighted items: 250ms animation cycle (slower, subtle)
   - Static items: No animation (performance optimization)

2. **Color Scheme**:
   - Gruvbox dark theme for consistent visual appeal
   - Selection indicator color: `Color::Rgb(184, 187, 38)` (gruvbox-green)
   - Glow effect color: `Color::Rgb(142, 192, 124)` (lighter green)
   - Dynamic color alternation for subtle glow effect

3. **UI Layout**:
   - 70/30 split between directory list and details panel
   - Dynamic pagination based on viewport height
   - Responsive design for different terminal sizes

### Performance Considerations
- **Animation Performance**: Efficient frame calculation with minimal CPU usage
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized data structures for large directory lists
- **UI Responsiveness**: Non-blocking operations maintain 60fps rendering
- **Background Processing**: Size calculations don't impact UI performance

## Next Steps and Opportunities

### Immediate Opportunities
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile animation performance for very large lists
   - Optimize memory usage for 100k+ directory scenarios
   - Implement virtual scrolling for massive result sets

2. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Add configuration options for animation speeds
   - Implement custom color themes
   - Add keyboard shortcut customization
   - Add confirmation dialogs for delete operations

3. **Feature Extensions**
   - Additional bulk operations (move, copy, archive)
   - Export functionality (JSON, CSV, plain text)
   - Integration with external tools (fzf, ripgrep)

### Medium-term Opportunities
1. **Advanced Selection Features**
   - Range selection (Shift+click equivalent)
   - Pattern-based selection (regex matching)
   - Selection persistence across sessions

2. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - Directory tree visualization
   - Size distribution charts
   - File type analysis and breakdown

3. **Integration Capabilities**
   - IDE/editor plugin support
   - Shell integration (zsh/fish completions)
   - CI/CD pipeline integration

### Long-term Vision
1. **Plugin Architecture**
   - Custom command plugins
   - Extensible UI components
   - Third-party integrations

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Directory usage patterns
   - Historical size tracking
