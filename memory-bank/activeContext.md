# Active Context: dir-kill

## Current Work Focus

### Recent Major Achievement: Enhanced Selection System with Animated Directory Icons
The project has just completed a significant enhancement to the selection system, implementing:
- **Animated Directory Icons**: Open/closed states with selection indicators
- **Stylish Visual Feedback**: Replaced basic `[x]`/`[ ]` with sophisticated animated icons
- **Enhanced User Experience**: More intuitive and visually appealing interface

### Current State
- **All Core Features Complete**: CLI, TUI, selection, size calculation, testing
- **High Test Coverage**: 77 tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- **Production Ready**: All major functionality implemented and tested
- **Performance Optimized**: Real-time scanning, lazy loading, efficient UI

## Recent Changes

### Latest Enhancements (Most Recent)
1. **Animated Directory Icons** (`src/ui/mod.rs`)
   - Replaced static `[x]`/`[ ]` indicators with animated `üìÇ`/`üìÅ` icons
   - Different animation speeds for selected vs highlighted items
   - Added subtle selection checkmark alongside animated icons
   - Enhanced color scheme with glow effects

2. **Selection System Improvements**
   - Multi-select capabilities with keyboard shortcuts
   - Visual selection indicators with animated feedback
   - Selection summary with count and total size
   - Toggle selection mode functionality

3. **UI Polish and Refinements**
   - Gruvbox dark theme implementation
   - Real-time scanning with loading animations
   - Pagination with dynamic sizing
   - Multi-panel layout (directory list + details)

### Previous Major Milestones
1. **CLI Implementation** - clap-based command parsing
2. **TUI Foundation** - ratatui integration with crossterm
3. **File System Module** - Directory scanning and size calculation
4. **Real-time Scanning** - Background threads with channel communication
5. **Lazy Size Calculation** - Non-blocking size computation
6. **Selection System** - Multi-select with visual feedback
7. **Testing Infrastructure** - Comprehensive TDD approach

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Current Technical Decisions
1. **Animation Timing**: 
   - Selected items: 120ms animation cycle (faster, more attention-grabbing)
   - Highlighted items: 250ms animation cycle (slower, subtle)
   - Static items: No animation (performance optimization)

2. **Color Scheme**:
   - Gruvbox dark theme for consistent visual appeal
   - Selection indicator color: `Color::Rgb(184, 187, 38)` (gruvbox-green)
   - Glow effect color: `Color::Rgb(142, 192, 124)` (lighter green)
   - Dynamic color alternation for subtle glow effect

3. **UI Layout**:
   - 70/30 split between directory list and details panel
   - Dynamic pagination based on viewport height
   - Responsive design for different terminal sizes

### Performance Considerations
- **Animation Performance**: Efficient frame calculation with minimal CPU usage
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized data structures for large directory lists
- **UI Responsiveness**: Non-blocking operations maintain 60fps rendering
- **Background Processing**: Size calculations don't impact UI performance

## Next Steps and Opportunities

### Immediate Opportunities
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile animation performance for very large lists
   - Optimize memory usage for 100k+ directory scenarios
   - Implement virtual scrolling for massive result sets

2. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Add configuration options for animation speeds
   - Implement custom color themes
   - Add keyboard shortcut customization

3. **Feature Extensions**
   - Bulk operations on selected directories (delete, move, copy)
   - Export functionality (JSON, CSV, plain text)
   - Integration with external tools (fzf, ripgrep)

### Medium-term Opportunities
1. **Advanced Selection Features**
   - Range selection (Shift+click equivalent)
   - Pattern-based selection (regex matching)
   - Selection persistence across sessions

2. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - Directory tree visualization
   - Size distribution charts
   - File type analysis and breakdown

3. **Integration Capabilities**
   - IDE/editor plugin support
   - Shell integration (zsh/fish completions)
   - CI/CD pipeline integration

### Long-term Vision
1. **Plugin Architecture**
   - Custom command plugins
   - Extensible UI components
   - Third-party integrations

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Directory usage patterns
   - Historical size tracking
   - Predictive cleanup recommendations

## Current Challenges and Solutions

### Technical Challenges
1. **Race Conditions**: Successfully resolved with proper channel synchronization
2. **Terminal Compatibility**: Implemented fallback mechanisms for unsupported terminals
3. **Performance at Scale**: Optimized with lazy loading and efficient algorithms
4. **Memory Management**: Rust's ownership system prevents common issues

### User Experience Challenges
